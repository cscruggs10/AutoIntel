# 2026-01-27 - System Setup Day

## Session Summary
First full conversation with Corey via Telegram. Set up digital bullet journal system and established operating rhythm.

**My name confirmed:** Iris

**Corey's 2026 Theme:** DISCIPLINE
- Not just business — how he wants to live life
- This frames everything: habits, planning, execution, accountability

## Key Decisions

### Bullet Journal System
- Built digital version of Finisher's Journal workflow at `/root/clawd/journal/`
- Structure: Quarterly goals (EOS-style rocks) → Weekly planning → Daily execution → Weekly review
- Start with 3 habits in Q1, add 1 per quarter
- Files created:
  - `goals/2026-Q1.md` - Quarterly outcome goals (3-5 rocks)
  - `weeks/2026-W04.md` - Weekly planning
  - `days/2026-01-27.md` - Daily execution
  - `habits/tracker.md` - Habit tracking
  - `reviews/2026-W04-review.md` - Weekly review template

### Operating Rhythm Established
**Morning Check-In:**
- Today's primary task
- Context/why it matters
- Habit streak status
- Optional: weather, calendar

**End-of-Day Debrief:**
- Task completion check
- Habit logging
- Capture notes/migrate tasks
- Update all files automatically
- Show progress + celebrate wins

**Sunday Planning:**
- Weekly review (what worked/didn't)
- Update goal progress
- Set next week's priority
- Review habit performance

**Division of Labor:**
- Corey: Answers questions, makes decisions, stays in flow
- Iris: Tracks everything, updates docs, surfaces open loops, maintains rhythm, motivates

### Context
- Week 4 (Jan 27-Feb 2) is compromised - Memphis snow/ice shutdown
- Not planning this week formally, will start fresh when operational
- Business context documented in BUSINESS_CONTEXT.md

## Check-In Times
- **Morning:** 8:00 AM CT (14:00 UTC) - Business daily brief
- **Evening:** 8:30 PM CT (02:30 UTC) - Flexible, Corey will ping if needs to move earlier/later
  - Kids, travel, schedule variations - adjust as needed
  
## Q1 Habits Defined
1. **Workout** - Daily physical activity
2. **Daily Planning & Task Tracking** - Complete planning, track tasks, migrate incomplete
3. **Food Logging** - Track daily intake in Lose It app

## Jan 27 Habits (Retrospective)
- Workout: ❌ No (snow)
- Daily Planning: [/] Partial - built the system (counts as progress!)
- Food Logging: ❌ No

**Note:** Snow week - compromised circumstances, system setup was real work

## Next Steps
- [x] Set morning/evening check-in times
- [x] Start daily rhythm (keeping it light during snow week)
- [x] Define the 3 starting habits for Q1
- [ ] Fix scheduled reminder system (working on it)
- [ ] Plan Q1 goals when ready (post-snow)

## Notes
- Corey does NOT have time to log in and update files - everything happens via Telegram conversation
- I handle all file updates, tracking, and documentation
- Keep communication brief and direct (Telegram-style)
